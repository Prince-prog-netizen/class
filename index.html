       <h1> My Target in my life  </h1>
       <!-- <br> -->
       <p>When i passed class 12th then i wanted to prepare UPSC because my dream is to be an IAS officer but i heared that most of
        the selected candidate was engineering. I explored that why an engineer cracks UPSC easily as compare to BA/BSc/B-Com students.
        After knowing about this, i decided to be an engineer firstly sothat i could start UPSC preparation parallely with job.</p>
        <!-- <br> -->
        <h1>My target in College</h1>
        <p>Since 90% of my family members are doing goverment job due to which i have motivated to prepare GATE Examination
        for better rank in this so that i could get PSU as goverment job.I am not interested in private job.
        </p>

<h1>Extra activities</h1>
<!-- <br> -->
<p>I want to keep a best friend(BOY,GIRL) in our college but due to my lovely goal it seems that i should be single so that 
    i could focus on my goal without any distraction. If any girl in our college has good nature and discilpine then it will not create distraction. </p>
